            <p>For the Sabzland mobile application, I designed a user-centric UX to enhance the agricultural experience through advanced technology. As the UX Designer, I focused on understanding the needs of farmers, creating personas, and developing responsive wireframes. My work involved ensuring seamless functionality across various devices, conducting usability tests, and refining the visual design to align with Sabzlandâ€™s brand. Key features of the app include a comprehensive dashboard, task management tools, easy access to resources, and community engagement options. The final design successfully delivers an intuitive and engaging user experience, empowering farmers with valuable tools and information.</p>
